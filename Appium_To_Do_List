Issue with  H_scrolling.java====>  scroll with JavaScriptExecutor method is not functioning properly: When the function is used as a utility. Whereas, if it's
coded in the .java class file, will function properly.

Include all swiping gestures codes as utilities in the base file (For now).

 Make the included pdf document (At the project level = where the pom.xml file is) readable.

 In "G_longPress_javaScriptExecutorTest" provide an example for long pressing on the element using coordinates instead of a locator.
 
 Adding the global implicit wait, in the base file, in the @BeforeClass method (That starts the Appium server programmatically) renders
 "this.driver" error. Fix it !
 
 Eventually Explicit waits are to be utilized instead of the current implicit wait.
